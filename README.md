<h2>Project of website with posts</h2>

<h2>About</h2>

Project of blog web application where users can view, upload and manage posts. The idea of the project belongs to youtuber <b>Corey Shafer</b> (<a href="https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer">github</a>). Whole implementation is a carbon copy of material presented on his youtube channel but with my own branching, commits, notes, enhancements etc.

<h2>Main features of app</h2>
<li> Creating, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) posts by users
<li> User login system
<li> Pagination of posts
<li> Authorization and authentication of users (limited access to web resources for users i.e. only owner of post can modify his posts)
